# ðŸ“¦ PHP Native MVC App

This is a simple PHP native application built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. It serves as a foundational example for understanding how to structure PHP projects without relying on frameworks.

## ðŸ§  About MVC

MVC stands for:
- **Model**: Handles data and business logic.
- **View**: Manages the presentation layer.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View, handling user input and updating both.

This architecture promotes clean separation of concerns, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable.
